Data Download:
--------------
I provided the post-processed dataset we created below. This downloads RST-Annotated texts across multiple sub-reddits:

1. To download the necessary data files, run the `download_data.py` script:
```python .data/download_data.py```

This script will download all the files from the shared [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1seqNux3ycMLl-FMqbDRa3F5LhP7r61vG?usp=sharing). 
The files, which are compressed with .tar.gz compression, will be decompressed and saved to the local directory `./data/data_files`.
